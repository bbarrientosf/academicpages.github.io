I am a third year PhD Student in MIT Operations Research Center currently advised by [Daniel Freund](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/directory/daniel-freund). I hold a Bachelor's Degree in Mathematics from the University of Chile, as well as a Master's Degree in Operations Management from the same university. I also have work experience in three different companies: [LVA Indices](https://web.lvaindices.com/), [VTR](https://vtr.com/), and the [Center for Mathematical Modeling](https://www.cmm.uchile.cl/), where I worked on research and development of models, primarily in the area of price prediction and market behavior. I also have additional experience as a teaching assistant at the University of Chile, where I provided tutoring and instruction on various mathematical subjects.
